	acceptance of the risks involved with Martial Arts training. By assuming this risk, I completely waive for myself, my
	heirs and assigns, any and all rights, now and forever, and absolve the Company, its owners, staff, students and any
	other affiliated parties, of liability for any such injuries or damages. <br/> <br/>

	medium) for advertising, trade, promotion, exhibition, or any other lawful purposes. I waive any right to inspect
	or approve the use of my image or finished version(s) incorporating same, including without limitation, written
	copy used with such image. I hereby release and agree to hold harmless TTKD from any liability by virtue of any use

	obtained or provided pursuant to this Consent, and I hereby waive any claims I have based on any usage of such
	image derived therefrom, including but not limited to claims for either invasion of privacy or libel. I am of full
	age and competent to sign this Consent or, if so indicated below, I am the parent or legal guardian of the minor
